<p>it's a few day i have started learning cuda. as i am studying Electrical Engineering (EE) ,i have a problem with understanding what is a thread and how it can increase speed of execution in a process. i did a short research and its result became the following post.</p>
<p>In EE we have a manner for getting information about a modern and complex system. For understanding how a system is working take a look at its old models when every thing had been bigger and the technology wasn't progressed enough for making everything on one chip. I think this manner also works in computer science.</p>
<p>in first i will talk about a simple single core system and then multi core one and at last we will talk about thread.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<div class="section" id="a-simple-single-core-system">
<h2>A simple single core System</h2>
<p>I know this that every single core can execute just one thing in a unit of time and i also knew that One of the operating system's main tasks is controlling multitasking. when you are reading this post maybe a music is playing  on your computer,you are downloading a file, and following text of this post with your mouse pointer. i said a CPU can only do one thing in a unit of a time. but right now you are doing multi tasks in the same time without any interruption and it seems they are executing in the same time.</p>
<p>the mystery of this event is in using <strong>Time Multiplexing</strong> (in operating system it is named scheduling). Time multiplexing have a lot of applications in EE. what is time multiplexing in plain English?</p>
<p>let's me give you an example for making it more clear. imagine there are two people in a room and they have one book. both of them want to read the book. consider they read with the same speed and it takes one hour to read the book each.</p>
<p>they can do it in several ways :</p>
<p>1- the first one starts reading and after one hour passes the book to second one.during the time which one of them is reading,the other one will do nothing and waits. in this way in total it takes two hours for them to read the book.</p>
<p>2- the first one starts reading and after a while for example one minute passes the book to the other one. In this way still in each unit of time one person is reading the book.in total it takes two hours but both of them will finish reading it together. in this way they are reading in parallel. but it's not really parallel there is one minute IDLE time.</p>
<p>3- let's increase switching speed to 1000 times per second. In this case both of them will finish reading the book in just one hour.</p>
<p>Why does it take one hour less? Reading speed is still the same, and they just have one book.</p>
<p>In fact, because of increasing the switching speed (1 ms) they never notice that the book is not in their possession any more; consequently, they keep reading.</p>
<p>In your computer CPU is the book and your music player and browser are the readers.</p>
<p>What if instead of two people a thousand people were going to read the book at the same time? It would have been impossible. Since it took 1 second until the book was in your possession again (1ms x 1000 = 1 second), you have only 1ms to read, it would not work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-core-systems">
<h2>multi core systems</h2>
<p>Multi core CPUs were made in order to do multiple tasks concurrently. Now, operating systems are capable of assigning a process to different cores, as well as different time windows. This provides our programs with more processing power.</p>
<p><strong>As mentioned earlier, every process will just run on a single CPU core.</strong> if you have a program whose performance you are going to boost, and it is not designed for parallel computing, having even a hundred CPU cores is useless. The reason is that your program can use just one of that hundred CPU cores. now that we cannot use multiple CPUs we have to use a CPU which has a higher frequency (higher frequency means more instructions per second). However, there is also a limit here. I suppose there is no CPU on the market with clock frequency higher than 4 GHz.</p>
<p>it's a deadend. Thread is made for getting us out of this deadend. Thread is useful for taking advantage of maximum CPU processing power when our CPU has a lot of IDLE time (there is nothing to process).</p>
<p>as you know, CPU is a serial processor i.e. it takes instructions one by one and executes them one after another.</p>
<p>consider a program which takes an integer from the user and then passes it to a long complex function, and prints the result at last. when the program is running the function it cannot do anything else like getting another input and running the function on the new input too. if we want to do such a thing we should use threads.</p>
<p>the function that is going to be executed on the input is a set of CPU instructions. Every time we get a new input, we make a copy of these instructions, pass the required variables to it, and then detach it from the main body of the program. This detached part is called a thread. Now, our program is able to get another input and repeat the same process on the newly received input as well.</p>
<p>We know that ** a process can be executed only on single CPU core. Operating system treats the new thread like a new process. ** This means when OS assigns the parent process to a core it is likely that the threads of this parent process are assigned to another core. In this situation we are doing parallel computing and we can utilize maximum CPU power.</p>
<p>In our example inputs are not related to each other; thus, there is no need to stop processing new inputs while the previous process is going on. this event is name <strong>NON Blocking I/O</strong> . It's holiest rule is that no function is allowed to hold execution of the program and waiting Input/Output.the program should give control to the next function immediately.One of the methods for implementing NON BLOCKING I/O is Thread.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, OS assigns the Processes to CPU with a high speed. For assigning a new process to CPU. it should now state of last process which was on CPU.it needs this state to continue rest of the execution exactly from the point it was removed from the CPU.saving this state and loading the new one costs few instructions for CPU. this cycle is called CONTEXT SWITCH. If there were a lot of thread. This switching took all of the CPU time and a cause a huge performance drop(remember book switching with one thousand people).</p>

<p>as we compared earlier, you see that Threads, if used properly, will provide us with a lot facilities.</p>
